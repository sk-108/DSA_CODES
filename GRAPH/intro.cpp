// graph represent random connection of nodes while tree represent hierarchical connection
// real world example of undirected graph is social network (a is friend of b and vice versa)
// undirected degree = no of edges 
// in directed graph 2 types of degree indegree(edges comming in ) and outdegree (edges going out of it 
/*
in undirected graph it is symetric matrix 
in directed graph it is not symmetric matrix
to handle the vertices with arbitary name is done using hashtable with string and vertices no mapping
comparision between adjmatrix and adj list 
adjmatrix : space (O(v*v))
adjlist : space (O(v+e))
graph with low connectivity is called sparse graph
graph with high connectivity is called dense graph
